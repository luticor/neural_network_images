# neural_network_images

This really is just a project to test out a few concepts and get some more practice prototyping concepts in PyTorch. The project here is to try and represent an image as a differentiable function. Images are inherently difficult to replicate using a neural network, especially because of all the high-frequency content and textures that can be present.
